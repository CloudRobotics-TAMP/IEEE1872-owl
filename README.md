# IEEE1872-owl

IEEE1872-owl is an OWL specification of the Core Ontology for Robotics and Automation (CORA) and other ontologies in IEEE 1872-2015 standard.

# Included ontologies

We modularized the ontologies in different levels of axiomatization. The ontologies are:

* cora-bare.owl: A standalone taxonomy of the concepts and properties in CORA, without links to SUMO or CORAX.
* sumo-cora.owl: The taxonomy of concepts of SUMO used in the remaining ontologies.
* cora.owl: It is cora-base linked to sumo-cora, rparts and corax. This is the recommended implementation in this library.
* cora-fullaxiom.owl: A version of cora.owl + pos.owl with the result of our best effort to translate SUO-KIF axioms in SUMO and IEEE 1872-2015 to OWL. Use this implementation with care. 
* corax.owl: The OWL implrmentation of CORAX.
* rparts.owl: The OWL implementation of RPARTS.
* pos.owl: The OWL implementation of POS.
* annotation.owl: Some annotation properties for the ontologies in this project.

# Method for cora.owl

The translation from the specification in IEEE 1872 to IEEE1872-owl was made manually. We did not use any automatic translation tools. We tried to keep as maximum as possible the original ontological commitements of IEEE 1872. It is under-specified in relation to th SUO-KIF implementation. As a consequence, IEEE1872-owl allows models that are not consistent with IEEE 1872.

In general, we used the following rules:

* SUO-KIF concepts were translated to OWL classes.
* SUO-KIF binary relations were translated to OWL properties, taking into account their meta-properties (asymetric, reflexive, etc.) and their domain and ranges where possible.
* SUO-KIF class and relation taxonomies have been translated to the equivalent in OWL.
* SUO-KIF partitions have been translated to class disjointness axioms and unions over OWL classes.

# Method for pos.owl

The POS ontology include many ternary and one quaternary relation, as well as functions. Since these cannot be represented natively in OWL, we devised a reification method to represent them. More info can be found in the documentation of the classes _Relation and _Function in POS.

# Method for cora-fullaxiom.owl

Similar to cora.owl, adding:

* SUO-KIF axioms in SUMO having  the form "Concept(x) -> formula" were translated as subclass restrictions. Some have been ignored for being too specific  (such as the restriction that Objects must be mono or polychromatic) or cannot be represented in OWL. 

* SUO-KIF axioms in SUMO NOT having the form "Concept(x) -> formula" were avoided. We might have translate some of them if they: (a) are not too specific; or (b) do not force the inclusion of too many entities in the OWL ontology.

* SUO-KIF axioms in IEEE 1872-2015 were translated as subclass restrictions. It was not possible to translate some of them. All axioms have been anotated with cross-references to axioms in IEEE 1872-2015. See annotation property "IEEE 1872-2015 axiom code" for more info.
